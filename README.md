# data-inventory
In our data archive, we needed a tool for inventorizing a data folder or carrier in an easy und simple way. This VBA-Makro for Microsoft Excel let you choose a directory and creates a simple inventory of the most relevant file attributes (starting from your directory and for any files to the deepest hierarchy level). The Makro will read out the file attributes for path, file name, dates of creation, modify and last change, file size and file type. At the end it will then save a csv on your desktop and show you the attributes for further analysis.

Works well on Microsoft Excel (at least for Office 2016). Further developments for Office for Mac and/or OpenOffice are considered.
